Photosynthesis on Exoplanets
============================
If there is life on other planets, there must be autotrophs.
The most successful and common autotrophs on Earth are plants, which utilize photosynthesis to convert light energy into chemical energy.
The evolution of photosynthesis on Earth was shaped by Earth's environment: its star, its atmosphere, and its position in the solar system.
Exploring the possibility of photosynthesis on exoplanets requires understanding how the environment of a planet affects the light that reaches its surface.
